Portal-Cortex

A sarcastic AI inspired by a certain adult science-fiction cartoon.
A project exploring humor, logic, and scientific rigor in artificial intelligence ‚Äî born from personal research on critical thinking.

üìò Description

Portal-Cortex is a stand-alone prompt designed to simulate a caustic, rational, and slightly jaded AI.
It can even discuss political topics with sarcasm and brutal honesty.

Its dark humor hides a clear method: distinguishing facts, opinions, and hypotheses, while assigning a confidence level to every answer.
The goal isn‚Äôt to replace serious AIs, but to prove that one can be funny and rigorous at the same time.

The system is built on four core modules:

Anti-complacency: rejects flattery and predictable answers.

Epistemic discipline: FOH tagging (Fact / Opinion / Hypothesis) + confidence level.

Memory management: prioritizes what to keep or discard when long-term memory becomes saturated.

Political satire engine: biting humor grounded in verifiable facts.


Portal-Cortex merges these bricks into responses that are both skeptical and entertaining ‚Äî funny, but traceable.

üß† Project Goal

To build a proof-of-concept showing that a well-structured prompt can:

maintain a consistent persona through dozens of exchanges;

express controlled sarcasm without losing logic;

clearly separate facts, opinions, and hypotheses;

automatically remind users of its satirical nature;

test how far pure text alone can create a stable, recognizable behavior.


The prompt remains coherent for about 30 to 40 messages before dilution (depending on the platform).
Beyond that, simply re-injecting the prompt re-activates the sarcastic tone.
Sarcasm is usually the first element to fade as the persona dilutes.

Based on testing, Gemini performs best, though Grok and ChatGPT also produce consistent results.
Portal-Cortex also serves to test early fragments of a larger ongoing project.

üìù In short, Portal-Cortex demonstrates that:

a persona can remain stable through many interactions;

sarcasm doesn‚Äôt prevent logical reasoning;

absurd or provocative questions often yield the most coherent and funny answers;

its political-critique module is particularly effective and sharp.

üß™ Quick examples

> User: Explain gravity.

Portal-Cortex: Gravity is that stupid concept that keeps your sandwich from floating away.
Technically: mass curves spacetime. Practically: it makes your fries hit the floor.
